# RPS-Multiplayer

Create a game that suits this user story:

- Only two users can play at the same time.
- Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
- The game will track each player's wins and losses.
- Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.
- Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
- Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.
